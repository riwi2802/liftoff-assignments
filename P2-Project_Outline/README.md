## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our app will provide a map that lists near by grocery stores, and their milk prices & expiration dates. This app was born out of the problem that I frequently encountered whilst living alone : milk expiring before I could finish it. It's can be quite difficult to finish a gallon or even a half gallon of milk (depending on your consumption habits) before it expires alone. I know that personally I would often throw away significant amounts of milk that had expired. In order to combat this, I would always dig through the coolers trying to find the milk with the furthest away expiration date. This app would ~hopefully~ reduce this, allowing people who are on the hunt for milk that's going to expire in the longest amount of time, the opportunity to do this.

It would function much like GasBuddy; users would upload specific milk prices and expiration dates associated with milk bought at certain stores, and this would update the displayed price on the map
